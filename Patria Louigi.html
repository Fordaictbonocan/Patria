It is also known as Little Step Brother and Little Step Sister. Hansel and Gretel are siblings who are abandoned in a forest and fall into the hands of a witch who lives in a gingerbread, cake, and candy house. The witch, who has cannibalistic intentions, intends to fatten Hansel before eventually eating him. However, Gretel saves her brother by pushing the witch into her own oven, killing her, and escaping with the witch's treasure.

	 <p style="position: absolute; text-align: justify; left: 23%; top: 270px;">In medieval Germany, Hansel and Gretel are the young children of a poor woodcutter. When a famine settles over the land, the woodcutter's second wife tells the woodcutter to take the children into the woods and leave them there to fend for themselves, so that she and her husband do not starve to death. The woodcutter opposes the plan, but his wife claims that maybe a stranger will take the children in and provide for them, which the woodcutter and she simply cannot do. With the scheme seemingly justified, the woodcutter reluctantly is forced to submit to it. They are unaware that in the children's bedroom, Hansel and Gretel have overheard them. After the parents have gone to bed, Hansel sneaks out of the house and gathers as many white pebbles as he can, then returns to his room, reassuring Gretel that God will not forsake them.</p>

<p>The next day, the family walk deep into the woods and Hansel lays a trail of white pebbles. After their parents abandon them, the children wait for the moon to rise and then follow the pebbles back home. They return home safely, much to their stepmother's rage. Once again, provisions become scarce and the stepmother angrily orders her husband to take the children further into the woods and leave them there. Hansel and Gretel attempt to gather more pebbles, but find the front door locked.</p>

<p>The following morning, the family treks into the woods. Hansel takes a slice of bread and leaves a trail of bread crumbs for them to follow to return back home. However, after they are once again abandoned, they find that the birds have eaten the crumbs and they are lost in the woods. After days of wandering, they follow a dove to a clearing in the woods, and discover a gingerbread house. Hungry and tired, the children begin to eat the house, when the door opens and the elderly woman that lives there emerges and lures the children inside with the promise of soft beds and delicious food. They enter without realizing that their hostess is a witch who built the gingerbread house to waylay children to cook and eat them.</p>

<p>The next morning, the witch locks Hansel in an iron cage in the garden and forces Gretel into becoming a slave. The witch feeds Hansel regularly to fatten him up, but serves Gretel nothing but crab shells. The witch then tries to touch Hansel's finger to see how fat he has become, but Hansel cleverly offers a thin bone he found in the cage. As the witch's eyes are too weak to notice the deception, she is fooled into thinking Hansel is still too thin to eat. After weeks of this, the witch grows impatient and decides to eat Hansel anyway.</p>

<p>She prepares the oven for Hansel, but decides she is hungry enough to eat Gretel, too. She coaxes Gretel to the open oven and asks her to lean over in front of it to see if the fire is hot enough. Gretel, sensing the witch's intent, pretends she does not understand what the witch means. Infuriated, the witch demonstrates, and Gretel instantly shoves her into the hot oven, slams and bolts the door shut, killing the witch. Gretel frees Hansel from the cage and the pair discover a vase full of treasure, including precious stones. Putting the jewels into their clothing, the children set off for home. A white duck (swan in some versions) ferries them across an expanse of water, and at home they find only their father; his wife having died from an unknown cause. Their father had spent all his days lamenting the loss of his children, and is delighted to see them safe and sound. With the witch's wealth, they all live happily ever after.</p>

	 <h2>Characters</h2>
	 <h3>Hansel</h3>
<p>The main character of the fairy tale. He is portrayed as a resourceful, wise, and sensitive boy. His love for his sister is the main driver of his strength. He shows us his ingenuity for the first time when he remembers throwing pebbles while leaving home. Later we see again how smart he is, but also brave. While the evil witch holds them captive, he is moral support to his younger sister. Although his life is in danger at first, he always puts her needs before his. As an older brother, he does everything in his power to encourage and protect her. Although there are moments when he is also afraid, he skillfully hides it because he does not want Gretel to see it. The most important thing to him is that she thinks everything will be fine. Which is what happens in the end.</p>
<h3>Gretel</h3>
	 <p>The main heroine of the fairy tale. Hansel’s younger sister, who is much more sensitive and timid than him. She is much scarier and cries very easily. She is a good soul and every piece of bread she gives to her brother first, then she takes some for himself. Although at the beginning it seems to us that she is afraid of everything, she is the one who opposed the evil witch and freed them from captivity. She showed great courage. She saved her brother and herself from certain death.</p>
     <h3>Witch</h3>
     <p>She lived in a candy house. With that, she managed to lure the children inside and eventually ate them. She had planned to eat Hansel, but she didn't succeed. She is evil and malicious. She finds all sorts of ways to bring the children into her house. She thought that Hansel and Gretel were as naive as all the children before them, but she was wrong. They outsmarted her. She did not expect that two such small children would show such courage. And she lost the battle with them. Good has defeated evil.</p>
     <h3>Father</h3>
     <p>Although he falls under the influence of his wife who persuades him to leave the children in the woods, he has a kind soul. He is hardworking and fights for his family. He hopes that the children will return home and is sincerely happy with their return in the end. He fell under the influence of an evil woman and renounced his children, which is incomprehensible. Later, he realizes that his children are the most important thing in his life and that he must fight for them.</p>
     <h3>Mother</h3>
     <p>Another example of an evil woman who does something that’s not even imaginable today. She persuades her husband to give up his own children for her own benefit. Instead of being their mother, loving them, and fighting for them, she turns her back on them, leaves them, and almost takes them to their deaths.</p>
